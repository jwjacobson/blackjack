Coding Temple Weekend Project #4
***

This is my fourth weekend project for Coding Temple. The assignment was to make a Blackjack program using **object-oriented programming** in  **Python**.

I used a hybrid approach rather than full OOP: there is a player class instantiated as Player and Dealer, but other gameplay functions exist outside of classes.

This project was much more complicated than I anticipated. As a result I wasn't able to spend as much time on user interface features like colors and timing. They can onnly be found in the title menu.
